steps:
1. Download a feature extractor model of your choice, we downloaded AdaFace or_101 and Adaface ir_50 from the Adaface github repo.
2. If the file is not in ONNX format, use convert_file.py to convert it to ONNX format. The AdaFace models we used were in ckpt format so the code might not work if you have another format originally. In the function you have to specify which architecture the deep learning model has and the output path in which the model will be saved. 
3. Now you should have a model in ONNX format. The only thing left to do is to (possibly) remove one of the outputs of the model. This is because the AdaFace models have two outputs: the feature vector and a confidence score, but Insightface only accepts models that have one output: the feature vector. VART Ã„R KODEN
4. Now you should have a ONNX file in the right format. You can now create a new model directory by navigating to  ~/.insightface/models/ on your computer. There you should be able to find the bufalo_l model. What you do then is that you create a new folder with a name of your choice, then you copy all the files from the bufallo_l model except the feature extractor model into your new folder. This way you can use Insight Face as usual but with a new model for the feature extractor step.  
5. Then you can just call app = FaceAnalysis(name='your_model_zoo') to load these models.
